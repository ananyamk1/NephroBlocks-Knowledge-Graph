Neo4j-Based Clinical Trial Knowledge Graph
# Neo4j-Based Clinical Trial Knowledge Graph

## 🔍 Overview
This project utilizes **Neo4j, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Machine Learning (ML)** to interlink nephrology clinical trial research papers with patient profiles, improving data accessibility for researchers and patients. By transforming fragmented medical literature into a structured **graph database**, the system enables efficient query-based searches for clinical insights.

## 🏆 Key Features
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Extracts nephrology clinical trial literature using BeautifulSoup.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and summarization using NLP.
- **Machine Learning (ML) for Classification**: Implements **TF-IDF vectorization** and **K-means clustering** to group papers into disease-specific categories.
- **Graph Database Design (Neo4j)**: Maps relationships between drugs, treatments, diseases, authors, and trial data.
- **AI-Powered Query System**: Uses GPT-3-generated Cypher queries to generate queries for searches.

## 📊 Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: BeautifulSoup, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database**: Neo4j (Graph database) Aura DB
- **AI/ML**: GPT-3 API for query automation
